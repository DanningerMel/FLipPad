# Case for TM040040 trackpad

This case version is used for the bigger trackpad from Cirque.
The FreeCAD design in this folder is used for changing/adapting the case.
For renderings and animations, the STL files from this repository are transfered to the
FreeCAD project in the construction manual repo: https://github.com/benjaminaigner/ConstructionManual-FLipPad

To ease up the case design process, the PCBs and external parts are placed in the FreeCAD design.
